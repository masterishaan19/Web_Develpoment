				Maroon is all about you - Our aim is to empower every person in the country to independently connect with buyers and sellers online. Brainchild of Pranay Chulet, Maroon is widely known as India’s no. 1 online classifieds platform - and there’s a reason behind that. We care about you - and the transactions that bring you closer to your dreams. Want to buy your first car? We’re here for you. Want to sell commercial property to buy a home for your family? We’re here for you. Whatever job you’ve got, we promise to get it done.</p>
			<p>
				Founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bangalore, Maroon has left a memorable footprint in over 1000 cities. And we continue to work towards building the future of trading and e-commerce.

			In July 2015, we changed our brand identity to reflect who we are - dynamic, flexible and ready to adapt to the spirit of the contemporary Indian audience. In addition to that, we recently appointed actors Ranveer Singh and Suriya as our brand ambassadors. We’ve also launched Maroon Cars - venturing into the diverse range of automobiles i.e. cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our idea is to consistently keep adding something game-changing and worthwhile to your Maroon experience - whether it is MaroonNXT, the freedom to buy or sell without risking your privacy, or the missed call service, to give Maroon access to the masses who aren’t online today but would have internet access in the near future.
